# Analysis_of_Doxo_Studies


Pipelines used for the analysis of RNA-seq data of Doxorubicin-treated cells compared to control cells. The following data was used:

[1] **GSE135842**: RNA-seq data of human foreskin fibroblasts with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of p130 alone or in combination with RB1. Cells were further transfected with siRNA against the p107 transcript or control sequence and treated with either 0 or 350 nM Doxorubicin (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135842)

[2] **GSE198396**: RNA-seq data of human foreskin fibroblasts HCA2 cells. These were divided into normal HCA2 cells, PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative senescent HCA2 cells induced by 24 hours of 100 nM Doxorubicin treatement (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE198396)

[3] **GSE154101**: RNA-seq data of human pulmonary arterial adventitial fibroblasts treated with either vehicle control or Doxorubicin (0.5 Âµg/ml) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE154101)

[4] **GSE163361**: RNA-seq data of SUM149 and FCIBC02 Parental and Doxorubicin-resistant inflammatory breast cancer cell lines. Cells were also treated with either vehicle or Doxorubicin (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE163361)
